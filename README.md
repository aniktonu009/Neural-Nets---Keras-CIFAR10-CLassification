# Neural-Nets---Keras-CIFAR10-CLassification

CONCEPT

In this project, we will be building a Keras model from scratch to do some image classification. We're going to train our model and formulate our research question. Our goal is to build our image classifier, and it's going to classify ten different things. It will differentiate among dogs, ships, horses, frogs, deer, cats, trucks, cars, planes, and birds. In total, we're going to have ten different classes. And the simple model that we will use artificial neural network called Multi-layer Perceptron. It's one of the simplest kinds of neural networks. So we gather our data, clean our data process our data, explore and visualize some of the data. And then we're going to train our neural network on our local machine. And finally, we're going to evaluate how we're doing.
